        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Valentino Cattaneo's website. I am currently in my first semester of college at Purdue University, 
            studying First-Year Engineering. 
            This is the website where I will publish my work and accomplishments, so that's why it will be constantly under construction.
            For any questions, you can contact me through any of the platforms in the 
            <a href="contact.html">contact</a> webpage. 
        </p>

            At Purdue, I am the Vice President of the GoAERO Purdue team, where we're working on designing an autonomous, emergency
            rescue aircraft. We are currently performing  Concept Generation, Initial Sizing and Constraint Diagram for the
            different types of aircraft we are considering, which is part of our Systems Design Review process and documentation.
            More information on the competition <a target="_blank" href="https://www.herox.com/goaero">here</a>.

            Furthermore, I'm part of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) to work on my networking skills and 
            meet like-minded individuals who are driven to achieve their goals. I'm currently part of their MentorSHPE program, where 
            I was paired with a mentor that will help me in my journey at Purdue.

            In December of 2023, I recieved my high-school diploma "Bachiller en Literatura" as well as my Bilingual International 
            Baccalaureate Diploma at Northlands, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
