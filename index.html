        <h2>Hello,</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my website! I am Valentino Cattaneo, a sophomore pursuing a 
            <b>Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering</b> at <b>Purdue University</b> with a 4.0 GPA, 
            expected to graduate in December 2027. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At Purdue, I serve as the <b>President of VFS Purdue</b> for the International GoAERO VTOL 
            Competition, where I lead a team of ~20 Engineering students. Together, we design and build an autonomous 
            emergency rescue aircraft. Our team recently earned the 
            <a href="https://www.goaeroprize.com/stage-1-winning-teams/go-aero-purdue" 
            target="_blank"><b>U.S. University Innovation Award by NASA</b></a> in Stage 1 of the Competition.
            As part of Stage 2, we designed, constructed, and autonomously flown a 40% scaled-down prototype. 
            My technical work in the prototype consisted of MATLAB system modeling, 
             avionics and powertrain sizing, wiring design, and integration.
             For Stage 3 of the competition, I am working closely with the Powertrain lead to design our 400V battery
             and our Battery Management System.

            Since June 2025, I have been an <b>Undergraduate Research Assistant</b> at the 
            <a href="mattwklee.github.io" target="_blank"><b>Power Electronics and 
            Drives Research Lab</b></a>, where I focus on designing, modifying and testing 
            multi-phase motor drives and developing Sensored Field-Oriented Control (FOC) firmware 
            with STM and TI microcontrollers. My work also involves and relies heavily on
            troubleshooting issues using advanced lab equipment. I also gained teaching experience as a 
            <b>Mathematical Olympiads Tutor</b> before coming to Purdue, guiding students to the Argentinian Nationals phase.

            Before coming to Purdue, I was <b>Head Boy at Northlands School</b> in Argentina, where I led all student 
            activities, and I founded and served as <b>Chief Engineer of NorLatSat</b>, my school’s 
            CanSat (CubeSat-like) competition team. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about aerospace, power electronics, and autonomous systems, and I’m excited to 
            keep exploring how technology can solve real-world problems. You can learn more about me in the
