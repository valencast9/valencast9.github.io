        <h2>Hello,</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my website! I am Valentino Cattaneo, a sophomore pursuing a 
            <b>Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering</b> at <b>Purdue University</b> with 3.98 GPA, 
            expected to graduate in December 2027. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At Purdue, I serve as the <b>President of VFS Purdue</b> for the International GoAERO VTOL 
            Competition, where I lead a team of ~25 Engineering students. Together, we design and build an autonomous 
            emergency rescue aircraft. Our team recently earned the 
            <a href="https://www.goaeroprize.com/stage-1-winning-teams/go-aero-purdue" 
            target="_blank"><b>U.S. University Innovation Award by NASA</b></a> in Stage 1 of the Competition.
            As part of Stage 2, we designed, constructed, and autonomously flown a 40% scaled-down prototype. 
            My technical work in both stages consisted of drafting a preeliminary aircraft sizing algorithm in MATLAB, 
             avionics and propulsion sizing, wiring design, and integration of the avionics and propulsion of the prototype.
             For Stage 3 of the competition, I am working on leading the team towards designing and 
             manufacturing a human-carrying aircraft and coordinating all logistical and technical decisions towards 
             procuring, building, and flying, while also focusing my technical work in designing the 100V monitoring and balancing Battery Management System
             for our 14.4 kWh battery pack.

            Since June 2025, I have been an <b>Undergraduate Research Assistant</b> at the 
            <a href="mattwklee.github.io" target="_blank"><b>Power Electronics and 
            Drives Research Lab</b></a>, where I focus on designing, modifying and testing 
            multi-phase motor drives and developing Sensored Field-Oriented Control (FOC) firmware 
            with STM and TI microcontrollers for UAV applications. Currently, we're investigating a mode-switching controls algorithm implementation for a 
            dual 3-phase drive, where at low to medium power draw the drive only uses half of the phases (enabling more efficient operation of 
            a singular 3-phase inverter instead of having both working at a much lower Id than what they are designed for,  therefore reducing 
            efficiency of the system), and when higher speed (& torque) is needed, both inverters turn on, utilizing the 6 phases at the same time. 
            My work also involves and relies heavily on troubleshooting issues and tuning motor model and control parameters using advanced lab 
            equipment. I also gained teaching experience as a <b>Mathematical Olympiads Tutor</b> before coming to Purdue, guiding students 
            to the Argentinian Nationals phase.

            Before coming to Purdue, I was <b>Head Boy at Northlands School</b> in Argentina, where I led all student 
            activities, and I founded and served as <b>Chief Engineer of NorLatSat</b>, my school’s 
            CanSat (CubeSat-like) competition team. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about aerospace, electric propulsion, and autonomous systems, and I’m excited to 
            keep exploring how technology can solve real-world problems. You can learn more about me in the
