        <h2>Hello,</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Valentino Cattaneo's website. I am currently in my second semester of college at Purdue University, 
            studying First-Year Engineering. 
            This is the website where I will publish my work and accomplishments, so that's why it will be constantly under construction.
            For any questions, you can contact me through any of the platforms in the 
            <a href="contact.html">contact</a> webpage.

            At Purdue, I am the Vice President of the GoAero Purdue organization, where we're working on designing an autonomous, emergency
            rescue Urban Air Mobility aircraft. On December 11th of 2024, we sumbitted Stage 1 of the Competition, and the team is waiting 
            for results to be released on February 11th of 2025. We are currently working on our eVTOL's prototype, so the team can present the 
            Prototype Critical Design Review to our advising faculty on March 3rd. More information on the Competition can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.herox.com/goaero">here</a>.

            I'm also part of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) to work on my networking skills and 
            meet like-minded individuals who are driven to achieve their goals. Finally, this Spring 2025 semester, I joined 
            the Semiconductor Student Alliance, to increase my knowledge and gain valuable insights on the semiconductor industry, 
             and how working in it as an Engineer is like.

            In December of 2023, I recieved my high-school diploma "Bachiller en Literatura" as well as my Bilingual International 
            Baccalaureate Diploma at Northlands, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
