        <h2>Hello,</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my website! I am Valentino Cattaneo, a sophomore pursuing a 
            <b>Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering</b> at <b>Purdue University</b> with a 4.0 GPA, 
            expected to graduate in December 2027. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At Purdue, I serve as the <b>Vice President of VFS Purdue</b> for the International GoAERO VTOL 
            Competition, where I lead a team of 20 students. Together, we design and build an autonomous 
            emergency rescue aircraft. Our team recently earned the <b>U.S. University Innovation Grant by NASA</b>. 
            Aside from leading the team, my technical work spans from MATLAB system modeling to avionics design and integration, carbon-composite fabrication, and 
            designing and 3D-printing of mounts for miscellaneous components.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since June 2024, I have been an <b>Undergraduate Research Assistant</b> at the Power Electronics and 
            Drives Research Lab, where I focus on designing, modifying and testing multi-phase motor drives and developing Field-Oriented Control (FOC) firmware 
            with STM and TI microcontrollers. My work also involves and relies heavily on
            troubleshooting issues using advanced lab equipment. I also gained teaching experience as a 
            <b>Mathematical Olympiads Tutor</b> before coming to Purdue, guiding students to the Argentinian Nationals phase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond engineering, I was <b>Head Boy at Northlands School</b> in Argentina, where I led all student 
            activities, and I founded and served as <b>Chief Engineer of NorLatSat</b>, my school’s first 
            CanSat (CubeSat) competition team. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about aerospace, power electronics, and autonomous systems, and I’m excited to 
            keep exploring how technology can solve real-world problems. You can learn more about me in the
