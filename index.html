        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Valentino Cattaneo's website. I am currently in my first semester of college at Purdue University, 
            studying First-Year Engineering. 
            This is the website where I will publish my work and accomplishments, so that's why it will be constantly under construction.
            For any questions, you can contact me through any of the platforms in the 
            <a href="contact.html">contact</a> webpage. 
            <p> At Purdue, I am the Vice President of the GoAERO Purdue team, where we're working on designing an autonomous, emergency
                rescue aircraft. We are currently performing  Concept Generation, Initial Sizing and Constraint Diagram for the
                different types of aircraft we are considering, which is part of our Systems Design Review process and documentation.
                <br> Besides, I also joined Purdue Baja Racing as a member, where I am working on my CAD and FEA skills in order to
                start making meaninful contributions to the team. They have provided a very effective learning environment and been very
                helpful so far, so I'm eagerly working towards joining a subteam.
                <br> Furthermore, I joined the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) to work on my networking skills and 
                meet like-minded individuals who are driven to achieve their goals. I'm currently part of their MentorSHPE program, where 
                I was paired with a mentor that will help me in my journey at Purdue.
                </p>

        <p>In December of 2023, I recieved my high-school diploma "Bachiller en Literatura" at Northlands, Buenos Aires, 
            Argentina. As well, I scored a 36/45 in the IB diploma, getting a 7/7 in Physics HL and being the highest overall
            score in my class.
