        <h2>Hello,</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my website! I am Valentino Cattaneo, a sophomore pursuing a 
            <b>Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering</b> at <b>Purdue University</b> with a 4.0 GPA, 
            expected to graduate in December 2027. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At Purdue, I serve as the <b>Vice President of VFS Purdue</b> for the International GoAERO VTOL 
            Competition, where I lead a team of 20 students. Together, we design and build an autonomous 
            emergency rescue aircraft. Our team recently earned the <b>U.S. University Innovation Grant by NASA</b>. 
            My work spans from MATLAB system modeling to avionics integration, carbon-composite fabrication, and 
            3D-printed components for prototyping.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since June 2024, I have been an <b>Undergraduate Research Assistant</b> in the Purdue ECE Department, 
            modifying and testing multi-phase motor drives, developing Field-Oriented Control (FOC) firmware, and 
            troubleshooting using advanced instrumentation. I also gained teaching experience as a 
            <b>Mathematical Olympiads Tutor</b>, guiding students to the Nationals phase in Argentina.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond engineering, I was <b>Head Boy at Northlands School</b> in Argentina, where I led all student 
            activities, and I founded and served as <b>Chief Engineer of NorLatSat</b>, my school’s first 
            CubeSat competition team. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about aerospace, power electronics, and autonomous systems, and I’m excited to 
            keep exploring how technology can solve real-world problems. You can learn more in the 
            <a href="bio.html">Bio</a> and <a href="research.html">Research</a> sections.
