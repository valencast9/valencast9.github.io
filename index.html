        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Valentino Cattaneo's website. I am currently in my first semester of college at Purdue University, 
            studying First-Year Engineering. 
            This is the website where I will publish my work and accomplishments, so that's why it will be constantly under construction.
            For any questions, you can contact me through any of the platforms in the 
            <a href="contact.html">contact</a> webpage. 
            <p>I am currently a member of the clubs Purdue Space Programs (Active Controls division) and Purdue GoAero. Both clubs
                require a learning curve to start making meaningful contributions, so I am still in the process of learning the basis
            of system design and product development, as well as technical design. </p>
        </p>
        <p>In December of 2023, I recieved my high-school diploma "Bachiller en Literatura" at Northlands, Buenos Aires, 
            Argentina. As well, I scored a 36/45 in the IB diploma, getting a 7/7 in Physics HL and being the highest overall
            score in my class.
